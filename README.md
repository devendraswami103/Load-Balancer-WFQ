# Socket-Programming and Load Balancer for Web Server

Implemented one server-multiple client program ,supporting messages
broadcast and one-to-one private chat. Used pthread.h for multithreading and socket.h for creating TCP sockets. Created HTTP
web cache that stores recently accessed web pages retrived using Socket Programming and used LRU page removal approach.

Simulated Web Server Load Balancer. 
  -Developed a robust load balancer for a cloud-based web server cluster using the Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) algorithm in C++ to ensure efficient resource allocation.
   Engineered WFQ-based load balancing to prioritize traffic, rigorously tested across diverse scenarios including differential bandwidth, processing power, and high-volume stress tests.
